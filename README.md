# Kelsey DSouza's github-based home page

In time, I hope to use [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) to make this landing page more interactive, include some more demos, etc. 

Some initial notes to future-me:
- The repo name **has** to be kdz.github.io (same as public URL)
- A single index.html file is what is initially displayed
    - It can be static, or Elm-generated, ... or anything else
    - It can contain links, menus, links to demos, etc.
