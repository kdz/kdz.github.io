This folder will typically have the following structure:

## for demos of Elm projects

- A subfolder for each demo project, hand-made e.g. drag-n-drop, containing:
	- a build/ folder containing (only) the Elm-built final html or js files
	- a css/ folder with styles
	- an images/ or other similar folder for other assets
    - the individual project repos themselves should be totally separate
  - Url to each demo: kdz.github.io/demos/proj1/build/Main.html
